# Cheesy taco

You will need cheese, lots of cheese, all kinds of cheese and maybe a taco shell, 
alternatively also cheese can be used as shell, after the tace is filled, 
also add some grated cheese. Just in case it was too little.

In the end, ask Cheesus if your taco fullfilled all requirements for a cheesy taco.
